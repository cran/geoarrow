Description: Provides extension types and conversions to between R-native
  object types and 'Arrow' columnar types. This includes integration among
  the 'arrow', 'nanoarrow', 'sf', and 'wk' packages such that spatial
  metadata is preserved wherever possible. Extension type implementations
  ensure first-class geometry data type support in the 'arrow' and 'nanoarrow'
  packages.
